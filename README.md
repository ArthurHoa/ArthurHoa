## Dr. Arthur Hoarau - GitHub

Hi, I am a PhD in Machine Learning at CNRS Compiègne, I obtained my PhD at the University of Rennes in 2024. I graduated from a Master’s degree in engineering, specializing in data science. I have worked for very large French groups as well as for startups, but eventually I decided to focus on research and teaching. I am Co-Founder and former President of ADL.
I also had teaching assignments for the University of Rennes.
