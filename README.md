Hi, I am a PhD Student at IRISA - Université de Rennes 1. Recently graduated from a Master’s degree in engineering, specializing in data science. I have worked for very large French groups as well as for startups, but recently decided to focus on research and teaching. I am Co-Founder and President of ADL.
I also have teaching assignments for the University of Rennes 1.
